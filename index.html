        <p class="lead">We are excited to announce that the fellas are back at it!</p>
        <p>11 years ago the line up of Matt Bridges, Ben Bridges, Ronnie White, and Wade Byers were lighting up the Nashville rock and alternative scene. We are pleased to say that this line up has reunited with the addition of former FR2 bass player Will Day moving over to guitar. The pairing of Ronnie and Will and the solid rhythm section of Wade and Ben create a perfect canvas for Matt to move out front and complete the band.</p>

        <p>In the coming months FR2 will be <i>Steppin' Out</i> to the bars and music rooms. Some gigs will be announced soon so stay tuned.</p>
